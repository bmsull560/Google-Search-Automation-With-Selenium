# Google-Search-Automation-With-Selenium
This project uses Selenium, a popular browser automation tool, to perform automated Google searches and extract search results. The program interacts with the Google homepage, searches for a user-defined query, and retrieves the titles and URLs of the top search results. The results are saved to a text file for further analysis or reference.
