Project Description: Google Search Automation with Selenium
This project uses Selenium, a popular browser automation tool, to perform automated Google searches and extract search results. The program interacts with the Google homepage, searches for a user-defined query, and retrieves the titles and URLs of the top search results. The results are saved to a text file for further analysis or reference.

Key Features:
Automated Search: Inputs a search query into Google's search bar and executes the search.
Result Extraction: Extracts the titles and URLs of the top search results.
File Output: Saves the extracted data in a structured format to a text file.
User-Friendly: Minimal setup with straightforward configuration (e.g., path to the ChromeDriver).
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language for automation and data handling.
Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation and DOM interaction.
ChromeDriver: To enable Selenium to interface with Google Chrome.
Use Cases:
Quickly gather information or data from Google for research.
Automate repetitive search tasks.
Develop further insights or tools that rely on search data (e.g., keyword analysis, web scraping projects).
This project is an excellent example of how Selenium can simplify browser interactions and automate routine web tasks effectively.
